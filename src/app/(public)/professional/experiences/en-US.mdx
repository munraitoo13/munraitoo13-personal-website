## Designer

The beginning of my career was as a designer, where I worked with motion design and graphic design. I've worked with some clients and also with some companies, creating animations, logos, branding, etc.

### Motion Designer

(2016 - 2019)

Working on small projects but strict deadlines, animations and YouTube intros were my main focus. You can find some of my projects [here](https://www.youtube.com/munraitoo13). I've worked with:

- Cinema 4D for animations and modelling.
- After Effects for video editing and animations.
- Premiere Pro for video editing.

A lot was learned during this period, like creativity, design thinking, and how to work with deadlines.

### Graphic Designer

(2018 - 2020)

With some design experience and a lot of creativity, I started to work with graphic design, creating logos, branding, and other graphic materials. I've worked with:

- Photoshop, for photo editing and manipulation.
- Illustrator, for vectorial design.

Most of my design thinking, UI/UX and creativity skills were developed during this period.

## Developer

I was already familiar with programming, manipulating Minecraft mods and plugins, but I got it more seriously in 2020, when the pandemic started and I had more time to learn and practice.

### Front-end Developer

(2020 - 2021)

When migrating from design to programming, I worked with some front-end projects, creating small personal projects for practice. I started this journey with Python, but later got into the web development world. I've worked with:

- HTML, for the structure.
- CSS, for the style.
- JavaScript, for the behavior.

During this period, I learned a lot about web development, but mostly about being more productive when coding.

### Full-stack Developer

(2021 - Present)

Not satisfied with just the front-end, I started to work with back-end projects, as I wanted to create bigger applications. With more complex projects, the experience gained is huge:

- Clean code.
- Best practices.
- Logic.
- Problem-solving.

And a lot of other skills were, and are, being developed.

One crucial step was getting into FIAP — one of the best tech colleges in Brazil — where I'm currently studying to get a degree in Software Engineering.
