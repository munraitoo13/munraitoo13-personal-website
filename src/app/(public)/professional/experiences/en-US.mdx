## Developer

This is my current profession, where I work with a broad range of technologies, from front-end to back-end, and everything in between.

One of the most important steps of my developer career was joining FIAP, where I'm currently studying Software Engineering. This experience has been invaluable in deepening my understanding of software development principles and practices.

Without further ado, here are my experiences as a developer:

- Improved code quality and reduced production bugs by 30% by spearheading a code quality initiative that enforced stricter linting and implemented new testing protocols

It is being a great experience to this date, and I'm learning a lot with this new challenge.
