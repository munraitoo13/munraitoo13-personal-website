# Welcome!

I started my career as a freelance designer in 2016 and then migrated to the programming area. I have worked with several technologies and languages, but I have always been focused on web development. I have always tried to deliver the best possible solution.

## Designer

### Motion Designer

(2016 - 2019)

- I worked as a freelance motion designer for 3 years. I have worked on several projects, from small animations to large projects. Most of my projects you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/munraitoo13).
- I've worked with Cinema 4D, After Effects and Premiere Pro, but I have also worked with other tools like Blender and DaVinci Resolve.

### Graphic Designer

(2018 - 2021)

- As a freelance graphic designer, for 3 years I've worked on several projects, mostly small projects for small businesses. Most of my projects you can find [here](https://www.behance.net/munraitoo13).
- I've worked with Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, but I have also worked with other tools like Figma and Sketch.

## Developer

As i was working as a freelance designer, I started to learn programming. I started with Python and then moved to web development, then I found my passion for it, specially for the front-end development, due to my design background.

### Front-end Developer

(2021 - 2023)

- When migrating from design to programming, I worked with some front-end projects, creating small personal and professional projects, like landing pages and small web applications.
- I've worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and its frameworks, like React, Vue, TailwindCSS and others.

### Full-stack Developer

(2023 - Present)

In 2024 I started my software engineering degree at FIAP, where I am currently studying. Because of that I decided to go full-stack and work with more complex projects.

- As I gained more experience, I started working with full-stack projects, creating more complex web applications and APIs.
- Acting as a full-stack developer, I've worked with Node.js, Express, some SQL and NoSQL databases and other technologies.

With more complex projects and the knowledge I'm gaining from my degree, I started to work with some methodologies like Agile and Scrum, and also with some tools like Docker and Kubernetes.
