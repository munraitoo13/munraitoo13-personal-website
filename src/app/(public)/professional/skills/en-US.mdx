First of all, my objective is one and only: create high-quality software that meets the needs of users and businesses. Achieving this with some level of perfection is obviously hard as h\*ll, but with the right tools and technologies, it becomes a lot easier.

## Back-End Development

- JavaScript (Node.js, TypeScript), Golang and Python as programming languages
- Express, NestJS, Gin, FastAPI and Flask as frameworks
- MongoDB and DynamoDB as NoSQL databases
- PostgreSQL and MySQL as SQL databases
- Prisma and Mongoose as ORMs/ODMs
- JWT and OAuth2 for authentication

Those are the main technologies I use for back-end development. With this tech stack I have built several APIs and microservices, and I am comfortable working with databases and authentication mechanisms. Now, let's move on to front-end development.

## Front-End Development

- JavaScript (TypeScript) as programming language
- React, Next.js, Vue.js and Nuxt as frameworks
- Tailwind and Sass/SCSS for styling
- HTML5 and CSS3 as markup and styling

With those, I was able to build a huge variety of applications, from simple websites to complex web applications, so I have a good understanding of how to use them effectively. Finally, let's look at some additional tools and technologies I use.

## Additional Tools and Technologies

- Beekeeper Studio for database management
- Yaak for API testing
- Figma, Photoshop and Illustrator for design
- Visual Studio Code, Git and GitHub for development
- Obsidian and Notion for productivity
- Windows and Windows Subsystem for Linux as operating systems

Simple tools but very useful. They help me stay organized, collaborate with others, and streamline my workflow, without them, my work would be a lot harder.

By using this diverse set of technologies and tools, I am able to tackle a wide range of projects and challenges in the field of software development. It has been a rewarding journey so far, and I look forward to continuing to learn and grow in this ever-evolving industry.
