Since my age of 12, I've been in contact with technology, but I was more focused on the **design** side of things. I've been working with a lot of **different technologies and tools**, and this taught me _how things work and how to use them to my advantage_.

Nowdays, I found my passion on the **development** side of things, both front and backend. I'm always looking for new technologies and tools to learn and use in my projects, so take a look at the list below to see what I'm currently working with. :)

## Back-end Development

I thrive in backend development, where my objective lies in crafting **robust, efficient, and scalable solutions**. For that purpose, I'm currently working with the following technologies:

### Programming Languages

#### Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)

As my main backend technology, Node.js allows me to build fast and scalable network applications. I use it to create APIs, microservices, and server-side logic.

#### Ruby

Currently migrating from Node.js to Ruby, I'm using Ruby to build robust and scalable web applications.

### Frameworks & Libraries

#### Express

A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. I use it to build APIs, web applications, and server-side logic.

#### NestJS

A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.

#### Ruby on Rails

A web application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

### Databases

#### MongoDB

My preferred database. It's a NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. The ODMs libraries I use with MongoDB are:

#### PostgreSQL

A relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. The ORM library I use with PostgreSQL is:

#### SQLite

I use SQLite for small projects and testing purposes. It's a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. For it I use the following library:

### ORMs & ODMs

#### Mongoose

When working with MongoDB, I use Mongoose. It's a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

#### Typegoose

If using TypeScript with MongoDB, I use Typegoose. It's a TypeScript library that adds static typing to Mongoose models.

#### Sequelize

As an ORM for Node.js, Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.

### Auth

#### OAuth2

OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. I use it to provide secure delegated access to server resources.

#### JWT

The JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. I use it for authentication and authorization purposes.

## Front-end Development

My favorite part of development is the front-end. I love creating **beautiful and interactive user interfaces** that provide a **seamless user experience**. Things being said, I'm currently working with the following technologies:

### Markup, Styles & Scripts

#### HTML5

The standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

#### CSS3

The style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. I use the following libraries with CSS3:

#### JavaScript (TypeScript)

The programming language that enables interactive web pages and is an essential technology for modern web development.

### Libraries & Frameworks

#### React

My go-to JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's a declarative, efficient, and flexible library that allows me to create complex UIs with ease.

#### Next.js

As a React framework, Next.js enables functionalities such as SSR and generating static websites for React-based web applications.

#### Vue

Like React, Vue is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Like React, it's declarative, efficient, and flexible.

#### Nuxt

Like Next.js, it enables functionalities such as SSR and generating static websites for Vue-based web applications.

#### Tailwind CSS

My favorite approach for styles. It's a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It allows me to create beautiful and responsive designs with ease.

#### Sass (SCSS)

If not using Tailwind CSS, I use Sass for my styles. It provides me with more power and flexibility when writing styles.

### Testing

#### Jest

My go-to tester. I use it to test JavaScript code, including React and Vue components. Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

## Tools

As a developer, I use a lot of tools to make my life easier. Here are some of the tools I use on a daily basis:

### Productivity

#### Obsidian

About note-taking and knowledge management, I use Obsidian. It's a powerful knowledge base that is widely customizable. I use it to keep track of my projects, ideas, and notes.

#### Notion

Notion works as my task management tool. It's an all-in-one workspace but I use it mainly to keep track of my projects and tasks.

#### Visual Studio Code Insiders

As my main code editor, Visual Studio Code Insiders is where I spend most of my time coding. It's versatile, customizable, and has a great community with a lot of extensions and content to help me with my projects.

### Design

#### Figma

Figma is my go-to design tool. It's a web-based vector graphics editor and prototyping tool that allows multiple people to collaborate in real-time. I use it to create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes for my projects.

#### Photoshop and Illustrator

Both Adobe products are my go-to tools for image editing and vector graphics. I use them to create and edit images, illustrations, and icons for my projects. I also use them to create assets for my websites and applications.

### Operating Systems

#### Windows

My main operating system. I use it for general purposes, gaming and sometimes even for coding. It's a great OS for productivity and entertainment.

#### Arch Linux

My go-to operating system for coding. Arch Linux is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that tries to keep it basic. I use it mainly for development as it is my preferred Linux distro.

### DevOps

With the rise of DevOps, I've been looking into it and learning how to use it to my advantage. Here are some of the technologies I'm currently working with:

#### Docker

A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. I use it to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. It's a great tool for automating the deployment of applications.

#### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management. I use it to manage containerized applications in a clustered environment.
